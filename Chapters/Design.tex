\section{Planned System}
The system should support music file sharing using WebTorrent,
searching for content in a DHT system,
and playback of music in the browser.
We plan the following features:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Users can add music to the network
	\item Users can search for content, artists and albums
	\item Users can get music from peers
	\item Users can see ongoing downloads
	\item Users can see seeding content
	\item Users can see local content
	\item Users can play local content
	\item Users can play downloading content
	\item Peers retrieve and seed bad health content
	\item Peers use intelligent downloading strategy
	\item Peers persistantly store content
	\item Peers retrieve content from storage
	\item Peers seed local content
\end{itemize}

Searching for content should be handled by a Content Management System,
which should be a \acs{DHT} if one is available.
The \acs{GUI} has to be impressive enough to show that our system
could feasibly run behind a large, real-life, popular music service.

With the time limits of a quarter year,
we have limited the scope of our system compared to Spotify,
particularely in the areas of the \acs{GUI}, and development of subprojects.
In case we cannot find a reliable, functioning \acs{DHT} system developed for WebRTC,
we will instead make use of a faked \acs{DHT}.

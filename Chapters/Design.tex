\section{The optimal solution}
As previously stated in the introduction we are trying to build a decentrilized version of Spotify.
This means that the system should be a music-streamer with an interface that runs in a browser,
and makes it possible for the users to search for a song.

All the users (peers) should be the ones to provide the content of the system.
We strove to achive a minimum implementation of spotify.
Spotify have a social aspect where you can login, save your playlist, see your friends activity and discover new music.
Spotify have ordered their music into genres and top charts.
In Spotify there is a radio function where music is played based on artist or genres.
A radio function would be a good function in our system, because it would make users want to discover new music.
Our system could have a navigation pane in the left side, where it could be possible to see what music your friends are listening to, browse the top 50 charts with mixed music and for a given genre.
Users could be given suggestions based on their recently played music.

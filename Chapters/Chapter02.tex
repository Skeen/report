%BitTorrent
BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer protocol for file sharing designed by Bram Cohen in 2001.
The protocol is responsible for around 30 percent of the data uploaded to the internet.
The traditional way to ose the bittorrent protocol is to use a BitTorrent desktop client. That is a computer program that implements the BitTorrent protocol.
The .torrent files comes with a metadata file that includes a trackerlist. The bittorrent tracker is a server that contains information about what peers are interested in a given torrent. The tracker can connect a peer to other peers with the same torrent so the first peer can download and upload torrent data from and to those peers.

BitTorrent enhencement proposals is a place where users of BitTorrent can come with proposals to improve the protocol.
One of these proposals focuses on http seeding \citep{httpSeed}.
This is relevant in our work, because we focus on how we can make streaming work in the browser. The proposal is about changing the metadata file to include a httpseeds key. This key would refer to a list of web adresses where the torrent data can be downloaded from.

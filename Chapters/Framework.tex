\section{Browser versus desktop}
The main idea behind making a streamer for webbrowsers is, that it provides an easy way for the users to use the application without first having to install a client.

\section{Our implementation}
Throughout the project, we have developed in total 3 sub-projects;
\begin{itemize}
\item Angular2-interface: Our graphic user interface
\item music-streamer-library: A library utilized by our interface
\item fake-dht: A fake implementation of a DHT network
\end{itemize}

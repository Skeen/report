%% TODO: Clean up billeder
In order to demo our application, we first need to get it up and running.

\section{Getting the code}
There are two options in regards to getting our code up and running; either you
run it locally (and set it up yourself), or you run it remotely by utilizing
the system, that we've already setup.

Below we'll be going through both of these cases, starting with the more 
difficult local case, then moving on to the remote case.

\subsection{Running locally}
We've developed a docker image for our project, as such one can start the 
fake-dht backend server, and the http-server (serving our webinterface), using:
\begin{verbatim}
docker run -it -p 80:1987 -p 3000:3000 skeen/streamy
\end{verbatim}
After which the webinterface will be hosted on port 80, while the fake-dht,
will be running on port 3000. Assuming the docker instance is running locally,
one should be able to access the webinterface at: \url{http://localhost/}.

\subsection{Remotely}
We're running above mentioned docker image on a digital ocean server, as such
one can access the site by going to \url{http://skeen.info/}, or circumventing
DNS by going to \url{46.101.226.102}.

\section{Using the application}
At this point it's assumed that the system is up and running. If one is using 
the local setup, the dht will be empty, and no results will be found by
searching, while two results should pop up using the remote setup, namely;
\begin{itemize}
\item 'The Start': A chiptunes song by Tiasu
\item 'Pixelland': A chiptunes song by Kevin MacLeod
\end{itemize}
{\em Both of these songs are used with permission, and we've setup a node which will
be seeding them continously, until the exams are complete.}

\subsection{Uploading songs / Populating the DHT}
In order to add songs to the DHT, they must be uploaded to the network, by 
dropping them over within the drag-and-drop field on the bottom of the page.
When a song is dropped here; it is added to the DHT, saved to local storage,
and then it's seeded by the browser for others to download.

\subsection{Acquiring content}
At this point it's assumed that the DHT is populated, and that a seed for the
content is available. It's worth noting that the DHT does not clear out dead
content, or otherwise decay entries, as DHTs usually do, as such the DHT can 
somewhat easily be brought to an inconsistant state, i.e. where the DHT
contains content which does not have any seeds.
\newline\newline
At this point, one should be able to acquire information about a song from the
DHT, by entering the title of a song in the search field (top right corner).
The search field features typeahead, and whenever a suggestion is clicked,
detailed information about that content is displayed;

\newline
Clicking the artist or album, will look up their entries in the DHT, and thus
provide detailed information about these. Clicking the 'Download Song' button,
will initialize the download, and add an entry to the download tab, which will
continously update with information on the download process;

\includegraphics{gfx/download-info}
\newline
{\em It's preferable to use incognito mode, or different browsers for testing this,
as local storage is shared between tab, and may otherwise interfere.}
\newline\newline
Once the content is fully downloaded it'll move to the local tab, from which it
will be seeded and updated with seeding information.

\subsection{Playing back content}
The first step is playing back content, is to add the content to the playlist.
This can be done by using clicking one of the small plusses (+), on either the
local content tab, or the download tab.
\newline
After adding a song, one can double-click an entry in the playlist to start the
playback of that entry on the player at the top of the page.

Playing back from the downloads tab (i.e. playing back content, which is
currently downloading), setups the torrent in streaming mode, such that pieces
are download in the order they're needed, rather than in the typical
rarest-first order.
{\em Note that not all file formats can be streamed; streamability and playback
of different file formats is browser dependent, and given by the specific
implementation of the HTML5 audio tag.}
\newline\newline
The player contains a varity of buttons, these are considered to be self
explainatory for anyone whom has used a media player before. Below is a full
screenshot of our web-interface taken while playback of a local song is in
progress.

We encourage the reader to play around with the interface, including with the
features not documented here, such as downloading local-content to disk,
downloading by magnetURI, ect.

WebSocket is a transport protocol providing full-duplex communication channels,
over a single \acs{TCP} connection. The technology thus enables BSD-socket like data
transfers between the browser and a web-socket enabled backend server. That is;
a single open bi-directional connection, over which multiple messages may be
transmitted.
\newline\newline
It is an independent \acs{TCP}-based protocol, which only relationship with \acs{HTTP} is
that the handshake for the protocol is implemented as a \acs{HTTP} Upgrade request
(see \citep{RFC6455}).

The stated purpose of the protocol is;
\begin{displayquote}
To provide a mechanism for browser-based applications that need two-way
communication with servers that does not rely on opening multiple \acs{HTTP}
connections (e.g., using XMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling).
\end{displayquote}
The protocol is supported by most major browsers, including; Google Chrome,
Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari and Opera.

% Audio Tag capabilities
Adding support for music file types not already supported by the browser 
would be an major undertaking, 
and would not contribute much towards the goals of this project, 
so we have decided to make use of existing browser capabilities.

Most modern browsers support the HTML5 standard Audio tag, 
which presents a simple GUI and audio playback to the user.
Browsers also support a similar Video tag, 
which could also be used for audio playback purposes.
The audio and video tags support both files and streams, 
allowing playback while a file is still being downloaded.
Supported audio codings differ greatly between browsers:
Firefox and Opera do not support the proprietary formats Mp3, Mp4 or ADTS
without additional software on the machine.
Safari does not support the free open source formats WebM or Ogg,
and Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge does not support anything other than Mp3 and Mp4.
Google chrome notably supports all the above formats.

The audio tag itself offers a very simplistic yet very inflexible GUI to the user, 
it includes the usual progress bar, volume, play+pause buttons.

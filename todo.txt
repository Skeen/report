Abstract

* overall of project, write last

Intro

* Motivation
* Well documented case problem

Related Works

* BitTorrent
* WebRTC
* WebSockets
* Browserify/NodeJS (less important)
* HTML5
	- LocalStorage
	- audio tag
* DHT
	- Different DHT systems found
		(WebRTC-explorer, WebRTC-chord, Kad-WebRTC)
* Spotify
* Napster
* Popcorn-time
* Netflix (transitioning to bittorrent)
* File-sharing via torrents

Frameworks

* WebTorrent
* Browser vs desktop based (what is the difference?) 

Analysis

* audio tag support and capabilities
* Why we use browser torrents
* Song information
* WebRTC
* Tracker vs Trackerless
* BitTorrent BEPs (BEP9, 17, 19, 27, 44)
* Scraping
* LocalStorage
	- Why not cookies
	- Why not IndexedDB/mysql
* DHT
	- Mocking vs fake-dht

Design

* Song metadata
* LocalForage vs LocalStorage
	- LocalStorage limitations
	- Issues with LocalForage (blob vs buffer vs arraybuffer)
	- Workaround for localForage (save seperately)
* DHT
	- Issues with DHT on WebRTC
	- Tested DHT systems
	- WebRTC-Explorer (issues with)
	- WebRTC-chord (issues with)
	- Kad-WebRTC (issues with)
	
* Granularity of torrents
	- download song, album or discography?

Implementation

* Browserify and why we use it.
* Code Architecture
	- flow diagrams
	- file responsibility overview
	- Block Diagram
	- Seperation of concerns?
* User Interface (Angular)

Evaluation

* Analysis results
	- Capabilities compared to existing systems
	- Is it useful/not useful?
	- What does our system prove from research standpoint?

* What did we not implement?
	- Seeder eviction
	- Eviction strategies
	- Resource limitations
	- Bad Health supported properly?
	- Missing features on GUI (why there are unused GUI source code)
	- Fake DHT impl, what problems it causes
	- Missing trackerless feature
	- Could DHT and trackerless be implemented with more work?

* Quantifiable Tests (Reproducible) (performance, robustness)
	- CPU utilization when using/not using parts of project?
	- LocalStorage performance degredation?
	- Memory use?
	- Comparison with spotify/others
	- Reported traffic by webtorrent
		Is it correct+complete?

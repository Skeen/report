Analysis

* Song information
* WebRTC
* Tracker vs Trackerless
* BitTorrent BEPs (BEP9, 17, 19, 27, 44)
* Scraping
* LocalStorage
	- Why not cookies
	- Why not IndexedDB/mysql
* DHT
	- Mocking vs fake-dht
	-  

Design
* Song metadata
* LocalForage vs LocalStorage
	- LocalStorage limitations
	- Issues with LocalForage (blob vs buffer vs arraybuffer)
	- Workaround for localForage (save seperately)
* DHT
	- Issues with DHT on WebRTC
	- Tested DHT systems
	- WebRTC-Explorer (issues with)
	- WebRTC-chord (issues with)
	- Kad-WebRTC (issues with)
	
* Granularity of torrents
	- download song, album or discography?

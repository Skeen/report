% What should a thesis contain:

\ctparttext{The following reflects what I believe to be a good structure
  for a report or a thesis in experimental computer science. 
It contains a natural progression from the general to the specific, and
from the work of others to the work by the authors, each chapter
forming the foundation of the next.}
\part{The Proper Structure of a Thesis}
\label{part:prop-struct-thes}
\cleardoublepage

\chapter{Introduction}
\label{ch:introduction}
\input{Chapters/Introduction}

%Whereas the purpose of the Introduction chapter was to entice and
%convince the reader that work reported is interesting, that the author
%is asking the right questions about it, and reading about it will be
%worthwhile, the purpose of the Related Work chapter is to
%demonstrate that the author possesses a fine overview and keen
%understanding of the topic of the work.  Note that while the title of
%the chapter is ``Related Work'', it might as well be called
%``\emph{Relevant} Work'' in that you should only include work that are
%useful or relevant to your purpose. 
%
%Writing about others' work can be challenging---it is easy to succumb
%to just writing condensed summaries, which is just as tedious to read
%as they are to write. A better method is to gain an overview over the
%field of inquiry, and then establish in the first section what aspects
%or dimensions are crucial to systems or methodologies such as the ones
%described. This demonstrates to the reader that the author has
%understanding and judgement. Having done this, every paper or work can
%then be described in those established terms. This makes for easier
%and much more structured writing, and it also helps the reader
%differentiate the systems and works reported on. If there are multiple
%works that cover approximately the same area (\eg, using the same
%technique), you may mention several, but only go into detail with the
%most significant or representative one.
%
%The chapter can then be concluded with a table summarising all the
%work reported on using the aspects defined in the introduction of the
%chapter.
%
%A crucial element of this chapter is that it concerns the work of
%others and \emph{only} that. While the selection of aspects or
%dimensions described above invariantly will reflect your own focus,
%that should be the extend of which your own work and plans influence
%this chapter.  Your own judgement comes in the next chapter.

%\section{Frameworks and Technologies}
%\label{sec:fram-techn}

\chapter{Related Work}
\label{cha:related-work}
\input{Chapters/RelatedWork}

\input{Chapters/Framework}

%Related work need not be only published academic work. In many cases,
%it is also relevant to describe crucial frameworks and technologies
%that will be used or are relevant for the thesis.  This does not mean
%that all employed technologies should be described in detail, but
%frameworks and technologies that are unusual (for lack of a better
%word) could be described here. \Eg, there is no need to describe an
%ordinary network stack, but if the work involves GPU programming, a
%description of the chosen architecture might well be relevant, as it
%informs all the following chapters.

\chapter{Analysis}
\label{cha:analysis}
\input{Chapters/Analysis}

%% TODO: Move this about
\input{Chapters/WebSockets}
%% TODO: Move this about
\input{Chapters/WebTorrent}
%% TODO: Move this about, but after WebTorrent
\input{Chapters/Tracker}

%This is where the author can answer the question of what use we can
%derive from all the works described in the previous chapter. Ideally,
%the summary of the related work will show that there is room
%unexplored for what the authors have in mind. If there are differences
%between the included works on key aspects in the approach to be taken,
%this is where this should be identified, and a decision reached.

%Having written the analysis, the author has all the tools needed to
%complete the next chapter.

\chapter{Design}
\label{cha:design}
\input{Chapters/Design}
%
%Many of the other natural sciences have labs with equipment that has
%to be configured correctly to experimentally test stated hypotheses.
%Such experiments must be planned and designed in advance to work
%properly and provide valid and trustworthy results.
%
%As computer scientists, we usually do not work in labs, and our
%experiments do not live in petri dishes. Still, we have hypotheses to
%test, and thus, experiments to plan. This planning phase is the
%design, where the authors describe the system intended to test the
%hypotheses posed in the introduction.
%
%A luxury of the design chapter is that the design may well go further
%than solely the confirmation or refutation of the hypotheses.  If you
%are building a system, this is where you show that you know how to
%design one, even if you will actually not be implementing all of it.
%If you had sufficient time and resources, this is how you would make
%your system.
%
%However, before we come to that, it is necessary to investigate
%whether the required hypotheses are valid. If they are not, the design
%must be reconsidered, and there is only one way to test them, namely
%through implementation, and subsequent evaluation.

\chapter{Implementation}
\label{cha:implementation}
\input{Chapters/Implementation}

%% TODO: Move this about
\input{Chapters/CMS}

%Where the design chapter concerned itself with the overall plan, this
%is where the actual experiment in the form of an implementation is
%taking form.  It is not the purpose of the implementation to fully
%realise the design described in the previous chapter. It is the
%exclusive purpose of the implementation (a subset of the design) to
%either validate or refute the hypotheses put forth in the
%introduction. This, and nothing else. If it does less, you have posed
%questions you are not prepared to answer; if it does more, you should
%be coding less or asking more questions.
%
%If it illustrates core aspects, \eg, the inner working of a particular
%important algorithm or function, code segments are welcome in this
%chapter, as long as they are short, to the point, well-commented and
%-formatted.  It is also a good idea to provide the reader with a
%general overview of the structure of the code, as well as how
%communication between various parts take place.  The complete code (as
%well as your data) should be included separately with your report in
%the form of a zip-file or USB-stick.
%
%Overall, the implementation is the computer scientist's equivalent of
%lab equipment carefully arranged into a experimental setup, and just
%as the validity of an experimental investigation will be judged in
%part on the craftsmanship of the setup, so will the quality of your
%implementation. It is therefore important to clearly communicate how
%your system works, so that the reader may have confidence in your
%evaluation and conclusions.


\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{cha:evaluation}
\input{Chapters/Evaluation}
%Having built the equivalent of a experimental setup, it is time to use
%the implementation to test the hypotheses.
